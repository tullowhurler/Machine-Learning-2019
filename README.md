# Machine-Learning-2019
## Boston House Prices Dataset Project GMIT 2019

My name is Brian Condon and I am creating this Jupyter notebook and github repository to analyse the Boston House Prices dataset. The purpose of the project is to create a neural network capable of accurately predicting the house prices of the houses in the dataset.
I will be using Python programming language and employing various different packages from the Python library including Keras for the machine learning part of the project (https://keras.io/).
